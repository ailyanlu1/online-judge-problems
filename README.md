Online Judge Problems
===================
In this repository you will find some solved problems of diverse online judges.

Many of the problems here are also found in the repository of one of my colleagues in the ACMP-ICPC SWERC programming contest [here](https://github.com/rhaps0dy/UPF-SWERC). There you will also find the notebook with the code we used in the contest.
